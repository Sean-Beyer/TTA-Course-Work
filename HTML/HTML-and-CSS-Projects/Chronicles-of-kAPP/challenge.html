						<p>Waking up in a android re-purposing facility, kAPP's only memories were broken and scattered. The brief glimpses he got were only enough to make the most centered of beings mad.</p>
						<p>He sought everywhere for help but was only laughed at as a defunct android. An eavesdropper heard his plight and convinced kAPP to join his pirate crew with the promise to help sort his memories.</p>
						<p>As the chief engineer for this ship, the only revelation came in the form of Murco, his trusted ally and survaillence drone. To this day, kAPP is still not sure if he brought this intelligence to life or if fate had it's way.</p>
						<p>kAPP became more aware that his captain had began to loose his mind, in search of an artifact that the crew started to believe didn't existed.</p>
						<p>The captain had given an order to make a run on a hellknight citadel ship and the crew reluctantly agreed until the bolts began to fall and they quickly abandoned ship. Last seeing the captain, howling in rage as he steered the ship into the overly powerful shields of the citadel.</p>
						<p>Desperate and without a home, kAPP and Murco were recruited to the Starfinder Society by Chiskisk and became and integral part in saving the galaxy from an ancient weapon.</p>
