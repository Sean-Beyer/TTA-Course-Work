			<p><h3>kAPP</h3> is an android who has no memory of his past life after he woke up in a repurposing center.</p>
		
			<p>He tried to get the Stewards to listen to him but they ingored him as a malfunctioning unit.</p>
		
			<p>When he was about to give up all hope of reclaiming his past, he was approached by a man claiming to be the captain of a starship in need of a chief mechanic.</P>
		
			<p>kAPP accepted the offer with a promise to explore himself. In this time, kAPP was able to tinker with his free time and created a drone with artificial intelligence in the form of an old world creature and was named <h1>"Murco."</h1></p>
